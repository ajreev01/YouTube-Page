# YouTube Page

This was my attempt at recreating a YouTube Page.
The YouTube project was constructed using HTML, CSS & FlexBox.
I wanted to dedicate a portion of the page to Team TreeHouse
as the resources they provided really helped shape my Coding
abilities and I am extremely thankful.

This project really tested my knowledge of layout and
responsive design.
