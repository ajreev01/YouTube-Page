# YouTube Page

The YouTube project was constructed using HTML, CSS & FlexBox.
This was my attempt at recreating a faux YouTube Page.
I wanted to dedicate a portion of the page to Team TreeHouse
as the resources they provided really helped shape my Coding
abilities and I am extremely thankful.

This project really tested my knowledge of layout and
responsive design.
